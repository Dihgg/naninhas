This mod introduces the concept of "naninhas" to AuthenticZ attachable plushies!
Each plushie will give a different bonus when attached to the backpack!

## Buffs
Each plushie grants a unique bonus when attached to your backpack. Only one plushie can be equipped at a time, and buffs are active while equipped.
